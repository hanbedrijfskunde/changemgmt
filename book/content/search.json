    "text": "2.1 Change\nIn the landscape of business administration, the concept of “gradual change blindness,” as illustrated by the Changing Room Illusion, provides a poignant parallel to the often-overlooked progression of technological disruption. Fourth-year business administration students are entering a professional world where change is not always a thunderous arrival of new technology but often a silent march of iterative updates and integrations. Similar to how multiple changes in the illusion escape detection, the nuanced increments of technology can remain under the corporate radar until their cumulative effect is suddenly and disruptively apparent.\nThis is particularly relevant when contrasting linear and exponential growth. Linear growth is steady and consistent, much like adding a single brick each day to construct a wall. It is intuitive and predictable, aligning with the human tendency to expect more of the same at a manageable rate. Exponential growth, on the other hand, represents the kind of rapid acceleration that defines many technological advancements. It starts deceptively slowly, then rapidly expands, becoming overwhelming in its scope and impact. This type of growth is emblematic of digital advancements where initial slow developments can quickly lead to transformative change.\nIn their their report Trends (2017) elucidate the impact of digitalization on the workforce. They highlight that technological proficiency is now a foundational element of human capital trends, demanding a reevaluation of traditional organizational structures. For businesses to remain viable and competitive in this swiftly evolving digital epoch, recognizing the signs of incremental change and preparing for its eventual acceleration is imperative.\nAs future business leaders, you will need to cultivate a keen sensitivity to the undercurrents of change. This means not only tracking disruptive trends but also building organizational resilience and adaptability. The ability to harness these subtle shifts, rather than be undermined by them, will determine the success of your strategic endeavors. Thus, embracing a mindset attuned to both immediate and horizon-level changes will be critical in navigating the complexities of tomorrow’s business challenges.",

    "section": "2.2 The Heroe’s Journey",
    "text": "2.2 The Heroe’s Journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: License & Source\n\n\n\nIn the realm of change management, the journey an organization embarks upon can be strikingly analogous to the hero’s journey, a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell. Just as a hero begins in an ordinary world, an organization starts in a state of stasis — a familiar, yet often complacent environment where existing processes and cultures are firmly rooted. The call to adventure in change management parallels the hero’s call, manifesting as market shifts, technological innovations, or internal challenges that compel the organization to step out of its comfort zone.\n\n\n\nAs the hero faces trials and meets mentors, an organization navigating change confronts obstacles and seeks guidance from change leaders or external consultants. These mentors, much like the wise figures in myth, provide the knowledge, tools, and support needed to navigate the uncertain path of transformation. The organization’s crossing of the threshold represents its commitment to change, leaving behind the old ways and venturing into the special world of new possibilities.\nThe ordeal in a hero’s journey is akin to the critical implementation phase where resistance, fear, and the strain of adaptation test the organization’s resolve. Yet, it is within this crucible that the greatest growth occurs. When the hero seizes the sword, the organization, too, grasps new competencies and insights that become integral to its evolution.\nAs the hero returns transformed, so does the organization ascend to a higher plane—more agile, resilient, and enlightened than before. This new state is not merely a destination but a plateau from which future journeys may begin. The organization’s return to a ‘new normal’ mirrors the hero’s return with the elixir—a renewal that enriches both its internal culture and its value to customers and stakeholders. This cyclical path of departure, initiation, and return is the essence of both the hero’s journey and the transformative odyssey of organizational change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping the Change Management Journey\n\n\n\nObjective: Draw parallels between the hero’s journey and the process of organizational change, aiding in the understanding and navigation of change management projects.\nMaterials Required:\n\nLarge sheets of paper or a whiteboard\nMarkers of various colors\nSticky notes in multiple colors\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Instructions:\n\nIntroduction to the Concept (15 minutes):\n\nWatch the video summarizing Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey stages.\nPay close attention to the diagram illustratating the hero’s journey.\n\nIdentifying the Ordinary World (15 minutes):\n\nJoin your team and grab some paper, sticky notes and markers.\nDiscuss the initial state of the organization before change began, known as the “ordinary world.”\nDraw or list elements on your storyboard that represent this phase for your assigned organization.\n\nRecognizing the Need for Change (15 minutes):\n\nDetermine what triggered the need for change in the organization, known as “the call to adventure.”\nAdd this inciting incident to your storyboard, depicting how it disrupted the organization’s equilibrium.\n\nEncountering Trials and Finding Guidance (20 minutes):\n\nIdentify the key challenges the organization faced during the change and the mentors who provided support.\nIllustrate the organization’s commitment to change, the “crossing of the threshold,” on your storyboard.\n\nOvercoming Challenges and Gaining Insights (20 minutes):\n\nDiscuss the critical challenges, or “the ordeal,” and the new skills or insights gained, known as “seizing the sword.”\nRepresent this transformation on your storyboard with appropriate symbols, drawings, or key terms.\n\nIllustrating the Transformation (20 minutes):\n\nVisualize the organization’s transformation and the “new normal” that emerged post-change.\nDetail how the change has positively impacted the organization on your storyboard.\n\nPresenting Your Journey (45 minutes):\n\nPrepare to present your storyboard to the class, explaining each stage of the organization’s journey through change.\nBe ready to discuss the metaphor’s relevance to the change management process.\n\nReflecting on the Experience (15 minutes):\n\nAfter all presentations, participate in a class discussion reflecting on the activity.\nThink about how this metaphorical journey can inform and guide your approach to change management in a real-world context.\n\n\nNote: Keep your storyboard as a reference to guide your project work with the business partners. Reflect on how each stage of the journey might apply to the challenges and opportunities you encounter during your change management project.",

    "text": "2.3 Business Case\n\n2.3.1 LEGO’s Heroic Journey\n\n\n\nOrdinary World: LEGO’s story began in the tranquil town of Billund, Denmark, in 1932. Created by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, LEGO bricks offered children endless possibilities for imaginative play. For decades, LEGO enjoyed steady growth, never facing a loss until the late 1990s. This period represents LEGO’s “ordinary world,” where traditional, analog toys were the foundation of children’s entertainment.\nThe Call to Adventure: The advent of the digital era in the early 2000s presented LEGO with its call to adventure. As video games and digital media began to dominate the toy industry, LEGO found its traditional brick sets under threat. This pivotal moment forced LEGO to confront the growing shift towards digital entertainment and reconsider its place in an evolving market.\nTrials, Mentors, and Crossing the Threshold: Faced with declining sales and a significant debt, LEGO embarked on a perilous journey. The company diversified its portfolio, venturing into video games, theme parks, and even clothing, in an attempt to remain relevant. However, these ventures almost led to the company’s downfall. The trial was LEGO’s near bankruptcy, and the mentor who emerged was Jørgen Vig Knudstorp. Knudstorp, a former McKinsey consultant, joined LEGO and swiftly ascended to CEO, recognizing that the core value of LEGO lay in its simple brick. He guided LEGO across the threshold, focusing on the brick’s potential to bridge the analog and digital worlds.\nThe Ordeal and Seizing the Sword: LEGO’s ordeal was its battle against obsolescence in the face of digital media’s ascendancy. The company realized that its strength lay not in abandoning the brick, but in integrating it with digital innovation. LEGO seized the sword by partnering with popular franchises like Star Wars, embracing content creation with The LEGO Movie, and engaging with its adult fan base. These strategies not only saved LEGO from financial ruin but also revitalized its brand, making it more relevant than ever.\nThe Return with the Elixir: Returning from its journey transformed, LEGO reclaimed its status as the world’s most powerful brand, with soaring profits and a global fan base that spans generations. The elixir LEGO brought back was a new understanding of its identity. By honoring its roots while embracing the future, LEGO ensured its place in both the analog and digital realms. Today, LEGO continues to innovate, focusing on sustainability, inclusivity, and the endless potential of creative play.\nThis journey of transformation, from near bankruptcy to unparalleled success, mirrors the hero’s journey. LEGO faced and overcame its trials, guided by visionary leadership, and returned victorious, its legacy secured for future generations to build upon.",

    "section": "2.4 Change Management Frameworks",
    "text": "2.4 Change Management Frameworks\nChange management is a crucial aspect of organizational development, focusing on the processes, tools, and techniques used to manage the people side of change to achieve desired business outcomes. This chapter explores three prominent models in change management: Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model, Prosci’s ADKAR Model, and Lewin’s Change Management Model.\n\n2.4.1 Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model\n\nJohn Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model is a widely recognized framework for managing change. It consists of eight distinct steps:\n\nEstablishing a Sense of Urgency: Creating a sense of urgency to drive change is essential. This involves identifying and communicating a compelling reason for change.\nCreating a Powerful Coalition: Building a strong coalition of individuals who can drive change is crucial. This involves identifying key stakeholders and aligning them around the change vision.\nCreating a Vision for Change: Developing a clear, inspiring vision for change is essential. This vision should be communicated effectively to gain support and commitment.\nCommunicating the Vision: Communicating the change vision and its benefits to all stakeholders is vital for success.\nEmpowering Others to Act: Empowering others to act and take ownership of the change is essential. This involves providing resources and support to enable change.\nPlanning for and Creating Short-Term Wins: Planning for and creating short-term wins is important to build momentum and maintain support for the change.\nConsolidating Gains and Sustaining Acceleration: Consolidating gains and sustaining acceleration is crucial to ensure the change is embedded and becomes the new norm.\nInstitutionalizing Change: Institutionalizing change is essential to ensure the change becomes a permanent part of the organization’s culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Prosci’s ADKAR Model\n\nProsci’s ADKAR Model is another popular change management model that focuses on individual change. It consists of five key elements:\n\nAwareness: Building awareness of the need for change and the change vision.\nDesire: Developing the desire to support and participate in the change.\nKnowledge: Providing the necessary knowledge and skills to implement the change.\nAbility: Enabling individuals to effectively execute the change.\nReinforcement: Reinforcing the change to ensure it becomes a habit and is sustained over time.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Lewin’s Change Management Model\n\nLewin’s Change Management Model, also known as the Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze Model, is a simple yet effective approach to change management. It consists of three stages:\n\nUnfreeze: This stage involves creating a sense of urgency and preparing the organization for change.\nChange: This stage involves implementing the change and making the necessary adjustments.\nRefreeze: This stage involves stabilizing the change and making it a permanent part of the organization’s culture.\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Translating the Models into Each Other\nWhile each model has its unique strengths, they can be translated into each other to provide a more comprehensive change management approach. For example, Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model can be seen as a more detailed version of Lewin’s Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze Model, with each step representing a different aspect of the change process. Similarly, the ADKAR Model can be seen as a more individual-focused approach, providing a framework for understanding and managing the personal aspects of change.\n\n\n2.4.5 Managerial Guide for Applying Change Models\nChange management models, such as Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model, Prosci’s ADKAR Model, and Lewin’s Change Management Model, provide valuable insights and frameworks for managing organizational change. However, these models should be adapted and integrated with the specific context of the change and the organization to ensure their effectiveness. Following are some key evidence-based change management principles to consider when applying these models in practice (Stouten, Rousseau, and De Cremer 2018).\n\n\n\n\n#\nPrinciple\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nDiagnosis Step #1\nCollecting detailed information to understand the need for change and pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n2\nDiagnosis Step #2\nEvaluating and addressing the organization's readiness for change.\n\n\n3\nEvidence-Based Interventions\nSelecting effective change interventions based on evidence and stakeholder input.\n\n\n4\nChange Leadership\nDeveloping leadership capabilities at all levels to support change.\n\n\n5\nCompelling Vision\nCreating and communicating a clear, motivating vision for the change.\n\n\n6\nSocial Networks\nLeveraging social networks within the organization to facilitate change.\n\n\n7\nEnabling Practices\nImplementing supportive structures and practices for effective change.\n\n\n8\nMicro-Processes\nEncouraging experimentation and adjustment of change initiatives.\n\n\n9\nAssess Progress\nPeriodically evaluating the change to make necessary adjustments.\n\n\n10\nInstitutionalize Change\nIntegrating the change into the organization's culture and systems for sustainability.",

    "text": "2.5 Businesss Cases\n\n2.5.1 Microsoft\n\n\n\nSeveral valuable lessons about change management can be learned from Satya Nadella’s journey as CEO of Microsoft, as outlined in the video. Here are key takeaways and how they align with evidence-based change management principles:\n\nEmbrace Change and Innovation (Principle 3: Implement Evidence-Based Change Interventions): Nadella’s leadership at Microsoft highlights the importance of embracing change and pursuing innovation, especially with his focus on cloud computing and AI technologies. This principle emphasizes the need for organizations to adopt evidence-based interventions. Nadella shifted Microsoft’s strategy towards areas like cloud services and open-source software, demonstrating a willingness to adapt and reinvent the company based on emerging trends and data.\nFocus on Mission and Culture (Principles 1 and 5): Under Nadella, Microsoft redefined its mission to “empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.” This refocusing on mission and the subsequent cultural shift towards a “learn-it-all” rather than a “know-it-all” culture reflects the principles of diagnosing the need for change and formulating a clear, compelling vision. Nadella understood that for change to be sustainable, it had to be rooted in a strong sense of purpose and supported by a culture that values learning and growth.\nCollaboration Over Competition (Principle 6: Work with Social Networks and Tap Their Influence): Nadella’s approach to partnerships and his decision to make Microsoft’s products available on competing platforms like iOS and Android demonstrate an understanding of the importance of leveraging social networks and collaborative ecosystems. By focusing on how Microsoft could contribute to and benefit from broader technological ecosystems, Nadella tapped into new sources of value and growth.\nEmpathy and Dialogue (Principle 10: Institutionalize the Change to Sustain Its Effectiveness): Nadella emphasized empathy and open dialogue within Microsoft. This approach to leadership and change management aligns with the principle of institutionalizing change, as it fosters an environment where continuous learning and adaptation become part of the organizational DNA. By valuing empathy and encouraging rich dialogue, Nadella worked to ensure that changes would be deeply embedded in Microsoft’s culture, leading to sustained effectiveness.\nNavigating Future Challenges (Principle 9: Monitor Progress and Adjust Strategies as Needed): The video also touches on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. Nadella’s focus on navigating the AI transition with responsibility and ethical consideration reflects the need for ongoing monitoring of progress and the willingness to adjust strategies based on new information and evolving circumstances.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Google\n\n\n\nThe social network experiment described in the video touches upon several key evidence-based change management principles, notably principles 1 and 3. Let’s explore how these principles relate to the described experiment.\n\nPrinciple 1: Diagnosis Step #1\nDescription: Gathering detailed information to understand the need for change and pre-existing conditions.\nConnection: The social network experiment conducted within Google aimed to understand the patterns of work-related advice-seeking among employees. This initiative represents a form of diagnosis where detailed information about internal social networks was collected. By identifying who employees turn to for advice, the company aimed to grasp the structure of informal networks, which is crucial for understanding existing collaboration patterns and potential areas for improvement. This principle directly applies here as the experiment sought to diagnose how social networks within the organization might influence performance, information flow, and ultimately, decision-making processes.\n\n\nPrinciple 3: Implement Evidence-Based Interventions\nDescription: Choosing interventions based on a well-conducted diagnosis, considering internal and external expertise, stakeholder input, and scientific evidence to identify solutions that address diagnosed problems.\nConnection: The identification of social network patterns allows Google to make informed decisions on interventions that could enhance collaboration, information sharing, and innovation across different segments of the company. For example, the findings could lead to creating cross-functional teams, redesigning physical workspaces to promote interactions among diverse groups, or developing programs that encourage networking beyond one’s immediate circle. This principle is exemplified by the proactive steps taken following the analysis, aiming to bridge the identified gaps and foster a more interconnected and collaborative culture.",

    "section": "2.6 Interventions",
    "text": "2.6 Interventions\n\nThe original De Caluwe model for change management interventions is based on five different ways of thinking about change, each representing different beliefs systems and convictions about how change works, the kind of interventions that are effective, and how to change people. These five models are labeled by color: yellow, blue, red, green, and white.\n\nYellow-Print Thinking: This model is based on socio-political concepts about organizations, where interests, conflicts, and power play important roles. It assumes that people change their standpoints only if their own interests are taken into account or if they are compelled to accept certain ideas. Combining ideas or points of view and forming coalitions or power blocks are favored methods in this type of change process.\nBlue-Print Thinking: This model is based on the rational design and implementation of change. It assumes that people or things will change if a clearly specified result is laid down beforehand. Controlling the change by managing, planning, and monitoring the progress is considered feasible. The process and the result are deemed, more or less, independent of people. Management is able to compel and effect the change.\nRed-Print Thinking: This model has its roots in action-learning theories. It emphasizes the human factor in change and focuses on stimulating, attracting, compelling, and guiding people to change. The human being must be influenced, and the foremost consideration is that the human factor plays a vital role in change.\nGreen-Print Thinking: This model is based on action-learning theories and learning organizations. It emphasizes the importance of collective learning and the strengthening of learning abilities within the organization. The aim is to strengthen the learning abilities of the individual and the learning within the organization, which leads to different organizational behavior and change as a result.\nWhite-Print Thinking: This model is based on the belief that “crisis provides opportunity.” It focuses on observing what is making things happen and change, supplying meanings and perspectives, removing obstacles, getting initiatives and explorations going, and empowering people while giving them sufficient free rein.\n\nThese models function as communication and diagnostic tools, providing a map of possible change strategies. Change agents can use these models to reflect on their own assumptions, competencies, and limitations, helping them to delineate their area of expertise and their professional development.\nThe model has significant implications for change agents and change processes.\n\nDiagnosing Organizations: The model emphasizes the need to diagnose organizations from different colored viewpoints to be aware of imbalances. Change agents must understand the dominant paradigms within groups or organizations to effectively characterize the actors involved in a change effort.\nSelecting Change Strategies: Different colored approaches can interfere with each other significantly. Change agents need to focus on a foundational color strategy that aligns with the organization’s context and issue at hand. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each color is crucial for selecting the most appropriate change strategy.\nManaging Interferences: Change agents should be mindful of potential interferences between different colored actions. Strategies to deal with interferences include spacing out interventions in time or involving different people for different color interventions. Maintaining a constant underlying color tenet while allowing for contributions from other colors can be challenging but beneficial.\nMatching Change Agents to Change Efforts: It is essential for change agents to align their approach with the nature of the change effort. Incongruence between the color of the change agent and the desired change strategy can impede progress. Ensuring that the change agent’s style matches the chosen color strategy is crucial for successful change implementation.\nFacilitating Learning and Adaptation: The model underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation within organizations. Change agents should create settings for collective learning, support people in taking ownership of their learning, and foster a culture of continuous learning in collective settings. This approach allows for flexibility, experimentation, and growth within the organization.\n\nBy understanding these implications and applying them effectively in practice, change agents can navigate complex change processes more adeptly, tailor interventions to specific organizational contexts, and foster sustainable organizational development through strategic and thoughtful change management practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting System - Knowledge\nHow Systems Change Over Time - Knowledge\nHow Systems Change Over Time - Skills\n\n\n\n\nOrganization behaviour\nA.

    "text": "3.1 Corporate Agility\nIn the swiftly evolving landscape of modern business, organizational agility stands out as a cornerstone for success. This concept captures a company’s proficiency in adjusting to both internal and external shifts, swiftly catering to customer needs, and spearheading changes that enhance culture, operational practices, and results. Central to agile methodologies is the Agile Manifesto, which prioritizes people and their interactions, functional products, collaborative customer relationships, and adaptability to change over rigid adherence to traditional processes and documentation.\nOrganizations that successfully integrate these agile principles and nurture an agile culture are better positioned to navigate market dynamics, enhance employee engagement, and secure superior business achievements.\nThe organizational agility conceptual map by Walter (2021) is designed to illustrate the key components and relationships within the concept of organizational agility (OA). The map is based on the original framework of Sharifi and Zhang (1999), which has been expanded and enriched with new insights. The map consists of four main categories:\nThe map shows the relationships between these categories, with agility drivers inducing the need for agility capabilities of the organization, which are realized by agility enablers, and agility capabilities being implemented in various agility dimensions, resulting in an overall enhanced organizational agility level. An increased OA level of the organization can contribute to an increase in competitiveness.\nThe Extended Agile Front End of Innovation Framework Brand et al. (2021) proposes a comprehensive model to enhance agility in the initial stages of the innovation process. This framework integrates findings from literature review and qualitative expert interviews to identify and detail key agility enablers that influence the front end of innovation.\nAt its core, the framework emphasizes the significance of adaptability, customer focus, empowerment, collaboration, and continuous improvement as fundamental principles. These principles are derived from agile methodologies and tailored to suit the context of innovation management, particularly in the early phases where ideas are generated, evaluated, and developed into potential projects.\nThe Extended Agile Front End of Innovation Framework aims to provide organizations with a structured yet flexible approach to navigating the complexities of the innovation process. By adopting these agility enablers, firms can enhance their capacity to innovate effectively, adapt to rapidly changing environments, and achieve sustained competitive advantage.",

    "text": "From: Lewrick (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Challenge: A Game of Chairs and Strategy\n\n\n\nIn this game, the king visits his people. However, the king is lazy and wishes to sit down as soon as possible. The people, on the other hand, want to keep the king walking for as long as possible. This is healthy and allows him to meet new subjects.\nObjective of the Game: To engage participants in a dynamic and strategic game that simulates leadership, engagement, and collective strategy.\nParticipant Instructions:\n\nSetting Up the Game:\n\n\nThe trainer is the king and selects one person from the group as his aide. The rest of the group represents the people.\nAn equal number of chairs as there are common subjects, plus one extra, are placed around the space. The chairs are randomly distributed throughout the area with enough space between them to allow for movement.\n\n\nCommencing the Game:\n\n\nWhen the game starts, all subjects are seated, and one chair is left empty.\nThe king walks toward the empty chair.\nTo prevent the king from sitting down, one subject stands up and attempts to occupy the empty chair before the king reaches it.\nHowever, this action leaves another chair empty, and the king proceeds towards it.\nAgain, a subject stands up to occupy that chair, and so on.\n\n\nConcluding the Round:\n\nThe round ends when the king finally sits down.\nAfter each round, take a moment to discuss as a group (without the king and the aide) how you can improve your strategy to keep the king moving longer in the next round.\n\nAbiding by the Rules:\n\nOnly the appointed aide may communicate directly with the king.\nChairs should remain in their initial positions throughout the game.\nAll movements should be dignified and orderly; running, pushing, pulling, or blocking is not allowed.\nAs soon as you rise from your chair, you must begin to walk.\n\nReflecting on the Experience:\n\nAfter the game, reflect on the group’s performance, the clarity of communication, and the engagement of each participant.\nDiscuss what strategies and approaches were effective in keeping the king moving and why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgility drivers: These are environmental changes that put organizations in a new, vulnerable position and necessitate searching for competitive advantages. They include customer-driven agility drivers, external changes only, and external and internal changes.\nAgility capabilities: These are specific abilities for providing the required power and competence to react to changes. They include responsiveness, competency, flexibility, and speed.\nAgility enablers: These are the elements that help organizations realize their agility capabilities. They are the means by which agility capabilities are implemented in various agility dimensions.\nAgility dimensions: These are the various areas in which agility capabilities are implemented, such as supply chain, workforce, business processes, strategy, information systems, and facilities.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Walter (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaptability: The framework underscores the importance of an organization’s ability to swiftly respond to changes in market conditions, technology, and customer needs. This involves flexibility in thinking, processes, and the allocation of resources to explore new opportunities and pivot when necessary.\nCustomer Focus: Central to the agile approach is the prioritization of customer satisfaction and engagement. The framework advocates for continuous interaction with customers to gain insights into their needs and preferences, which guides the innovation process and ensures that the outcomes are aligned with market demands.\nEmpowerment: Teams and individuals are empowered to make decisions, take ownership of projects, and drive them forward. This empowerment is facilitated by a supportive leadership style and an organizational culture that values initiative, creativity, and accountability.\nCollaboration: The framework highlights the role of collaboration among cross-functional teams, enabling the sharing of knowledge and skills. This collaborative environment fosters innovation by bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise to tackle challenges and explore new ideas.\nContinuous Improvement: Regular reflection on processes, strategies, and outcomes is encouraged to foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement. This involves iterative development, where feedback loops are used to refine ideas and approaches based on real-world insights and experiences.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Brand et al. (2021)",

    "text": "3.2 Business Case\n\n3.2.1 The Spotify Model\nThe case study of a telecommunications company grappling with the challenges of outsourced IT development and a lack of internal competence presents a compelling narrative on the importance of organizational agility. Faced with the urgent threat posed by Google’s strategic move into customer contact via APIs, the company found itself in a dire need for transformation. This situation underscores the criticality of agility in responding to market pressures and competitive threats. The urgency to adapt and innovate became a catalyst for change, illustrating how external challenges can drive organizations to reevaluate their operational models and embark on agile transformations.\nThis journey towards organizational agility involved addressing deep-rooted issues such as the overabundance of coordinators versus engineers, lack of transparency, and a disconnection from the development process. The initiative to bring about change was not merely about adopting new labels like ‘squads’ and ‘tribes’ but involved a fundamental shift in how problems were solved and decisions were made. The move towards empowering teams to solve customer problems and the focus on developing a shared purpose highlight the transformative power of agile principles. This case illustrates that organizational agility extends beyond the adoption of agile methodologies at a team level—it requires a holistic change in culture, leadership, and strategy, aimed at enhancing responsiveness, fostering innovation, and ultimately securing a competitive advantage in a rapidly changing business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand, Marco, Victor Tiberius, Peter M Bican, and Alexander Brem. 2021. “Agility as an Innovation Driver: Towards an Agile Front End of Innovation Framework.” Review of Managerial Science 15 (1): 157–87.\n\n\nLewrick, Michael. 2022.

    "text": "The 4 L method of providing feedback on a training session is a structured approach that encourages reflective learning and actionable feedback. It stands for “Liked, Learned, Lacked, and Longed For.” This method helps participants articulate their thoughts on the training’s strengths, new knowledge gained, areas for improvement, and additional desires or needs. Here’s how participants can use the 4 L method to provide feedback:\n\n4.0.1 Instructions for Participants:\nIntroduction:\nAt the end of the training session, you will be asked to reflect on your experience and provide feedback using the 4 L method. This structured approach will help us understand what worked well, what knowledge you gained, what could be improved, and what else you wish the training could include.\n1. Liked:\n\nReflect on and list the aspects of the training session that you particularly enjoyed.\nConsider the content, teaching methods, activities, interactions, or any specific moments that stood out positively.\nExample: “I liked the group discussions because they allowed for diverse perspectives.”\n\n2. Learned:\n\nIdentify and note down new information, skills, insights, or perspectives you gained from the training session.\nThink about how the training expanded your knowledge or skills in a way that is beneficial to your personal or professional development.\nExample: “I learned a new technique for managing team conflict that I wasn’t aware of before.”\n\n3. Lacked:\n\nConsider and mention any areas where you felt the training session fell short.\nThis could relate to content that was not covered but should have been, unclear explanations, insufficient time for certain topics, or any other gaps you perceived.\nBe constructive in your criticism to help improve future sessions.\nExample: “The session lacked detailed examples of how to apply the theories in real-life scenarios.”\n\n4. Longed For:\n\nReflect on anything additional you wished the training session had included or covered more deeply.\nThis could be topics, skills, methods of delivery, or resources that would have enhanced your learning experience.\nExample: “I longed for more hands-on exercises to practice the techniques discussed.”\n\nProviding Your Feedback:\n\nOnce you have your thoughts organized around these four categories, you will be asked to share your feedback. This can be done verbally in a group setting, written on post-it notes and placed on a feedback wall, or submitted through a feedback form, depending on the session’s format.\nRemember, your feedback is invaluable for assessing the training’s effectiveness and making necessary adjustments to improve future sessions. Your honest and thoughtful responses are greatly appreciated.\n\nConclusion: By utilizing the 4 L method for providing feedback, you contribute to a culture of continuous improvement and learning. Your insights not only help enhance the quality of training sessions but also ensure they remain relevant and responsive to participants’ needs and expectations.",

    "text": "2.2 The Hero’s Journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: License & Source\n\n\n\nIn the realm of change management, the journey an organization embarks upon can be strikingly analogous to the hero’s journey, a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell. Just as a hero begins in an ordinary world, an organization starts in a state of stasis — a familiar, yet often complacent environment where existing processes and cultures are firmly rooted. The call to adventure in change management parallels the hero’s call, manifesting as market shifts, technological innovations, or internal challenges that compel the organization to step out of its comfort zone.\n\n\n\nAs the hero faces trials and meets mentors, an organization navigating change confronts obstacles and seeks guidance from change leaders or external consultants. These mentors, much like the wise figures in myth, provide the knowledge, tools, and support needed to navigate the uncertain path of transformation. The organization’s crossing of the threshold represents its commitment to change, leaving behind the old ways and venturing into the special world of new possibilities.\nThe ordeal in a hero’s journey is akin to the critical implementation phase where resistance, fear, and the strain of adaptation test the organization’s resolve. Yet, it is within this crucible that the greatest growth occurs. When the hero seizes the sword, the organization, too, grasps new competencies and insights that become integral to its evolution.\nAs the hero returns transformed, so does the organization ascend to a higher plane—more agile, resilient, and enlightened than before. This new state is not merely a destination but a plateau from which future journeys may begin. The organization’s return to a ‘new normal’ mirrors the hero’s return with the elixir—a renewal that enriches both its internal culture and its value to customers and stakeholders.
