In the landscape of business administration, the concept of "gradual change blindness," as illustrated by the Changing Room Illusion, provides a poignant parallel to the often-overlooked progression of technological disruption. Fourth-year business administration students are entering a professional world where change is not always a thunderous arrival of new technology but often a silent march of iterative updates and integrations. Similar to how multiple changes in the illusion escape detection, the nuanced increments of technology can remain under the corporate radar until their cumulative effect is suddenly and disruptively apparent.

This is particularly relevant when contrasting linear and exponential growth. Linear growth is steady and consistent, much like adding a single brick each day to construct a wall. It is intuitive and predictable, aligning with the human tendency to expect more of the same at a manageable rate. Exponential growth, on the other hand, represents the kind of rapid acceleration that defines many technological advancements. It starts deceptively slowly, then rapidly expands, becoming overwhelming in its scope and impact. This type of growth is emblematic of digital advancements where initial slow developments can quickly lead to transformative change.

In their their report @trends2017rewriting elucidate the impact of digitalization on the workforce. They highlight that technological proficiency is now a foundational element of human capital trends, demanding a reevaluation of traditional organizational structures. For businesses to remain viable and competitive in this swiftly evolving digital epoch, recognizing the signs of incremental change and preparing for its eventual acceleration is imperative.

As future business leaders, you will need to cultivate a keen sensitivity to the undercurrents of change. This means not only tracking disruptive trends but also building organizational resilience and adaptability. The ability to harness these subtle shifts, rather than be undermined by them, will determine the success of your strategic endeavors. Thus, embracing a mindset attuned to both immediate and horizon-level changes will be critical in navigating the complexities of tomorrow's business challenges.

## Linear vs exponential change

Envision allocating your savings into a long-term investment, specifically for a duration of 50 years. You are considering two potential options:

1.  An investment vehicle providing a steady 6% annual interest rate, with the interest paid out each period rather than being reinvested.
2.  An alternative option offering a 4% annual interest rate, with the additional feature of reinvesting the accrued interest, compounding at the same rate. It is important to note that both options are structured to discourage early termination of the investment due to unfavorable financial penalties before the term ends.

You are tasked with analyzing which option will result in exponential growth of your initial capital. Reflect upon the compounding nature of the second option compared to the linear growth of the first. Then, identify and explain your preferred investment choice, considering the potential long-term yield and your financial goals.

## The Hero's Journey

![[License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) & [Source](https://www.thearetical.com/the-heros-journey-spiral)](images/hero-journey.png){#fig-heroejourney}

In the realm of change management, the journey an organization embarks upon can be strikingly analogous to the hero's journey, a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell. Just as a hero begins in an ordinary world, an organization starts in a state of stasis — a familiar, yet often complacent environment where existing processes and cultures are firmly rooted. The call to adventure in change management parallels the hero's call, manifesting as market shifts, technological innovations, or internal challenges that compel the organization to step out of its comfort zone.

```{=html}

</div>
```
As the hero faces trials and meets mentors, an organization navigating change confronts obstacles and seeks guidance from change leaders or external consultants. These mentors, much like the wise figures in myth, provide the knowledge, tools, and support needed to navigate the uncertain path of transformation. The organization's crossing of the threshold represents its commitment to change, leaving behind the old ways and venturing into the special world of new possibilities.

The ordeal in a hero's journey is akin to the critical implementation phase where resistance, fear, and the strain of adaptation test the organization's resolve. Yet, it is within this crucible that the greatest growth occurs. When the hero seizes the sword, the organization, too, grasps new competencies and insights that become integral to its evolution.

As the hero returns transformed, so does the organization ascend to a higher plane—more agile, resilient, and enlightened than before. This new state is not merely a destination but a plateau from which future journeys may begin. The organization's return to a 'new normal' mirrors the hero's return with the elixir—a renewal that enriches both its internal culture and its value to customers and stakeholders. This cyclical path of departure, initiation, and return is the essence of both the hero's journey and the transformative odyssey of organizational change.

</div>
```

**Ordinary World:**
LEGO's story began in the tranquil town of Billund, Denmark, in 1932. Created by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, LEGO bricks offered children endless possibilities for imaginative play. For decades, LEGO enjoyed steady growth, never facing a loss until the late 1990s. This period represents LEGO's "ordinary world," where traditional, analog toys were the foundation of children's entertainment.

**The Call to Adventure:**
The advent of the digital era in the early 2000s presented LEGO with its call to adventure. As video games and digital media began to dominate the toy industry, LEGO found its traditional brick sets under threat. This pivotal moment forced LEGO to confront the growing shift towards digital entertainment and reconsider its place in an evolving market.

**Trials, Mentors, and Crossing the Threshold:**
Faced with declining sales and a significant debt, LEGO embarked on a perilous journey. The company diversified its portfolio, venturing into video games, theme parks, and even clothing, in an attempt to remain relevant. However, these ventures almost led to the company's downfall. The trial was LEGO's near bankruptcy, and the mentor who emerged was Jørgen Vig Knudstorp. Knudstorp, a former McKinsey consultant, joined LEGO and swiftly ascended to CEO, recognizing that the core value of LEGO lay in its simple brick. He guided LEGO across the threshold, focusing on the brick's potential to bridge the analog and digital worlds.

**The Ordeal and Seizing the Sword:**
LEGO's ordeal was its battle against obsolescence in the face of digital media's ascendancy. The company realized that its strength lay not in abandoning the brick, but in integrating it with digital innovation. LEGO seized the sword by partnering with popular franchises like Star Wars, embracing content creation with The LEGO Movie, and engaging with its adult fan base. These strategies not only saved LEGO from financial ruin but also revitalized its brand, making it more relevant than ever.

**The Return with the Elixir:**
Returning from its journey transformed, LEGO reclaimed its status as the world's most powerful brand, with soaring profits and a global fan base that spans generations. The elixir LEGO brought back was a new understanding of its identity. By honoring its roots while embracing the future, LEGO ensured its place in both the analog and digital realms. Today, LEGO continues to innovate, focusing on sustainability, inclusivity, and the endless potential of creative play.

This journey of transformation, from near bankruptcy to unparalleled success, mirrors the hero's journey. LEGO faced and overcame its trials, guided by visionary leadership, and returned victorious, its legacy secured for future generations to build upon.

## Change Management Frameworks

Change management is a crucial aspect of organizational development, focusing on the processes, tools, and techniques used to manage the people side of change to achieve desired business outcomes. This chapter explores three prominent models in change management: Kotter's 8-Step Change Model, Prosci's ADKAR Model, and Lewin's Change Management Model.

### Kotter's 8-Step Change Model

![](https://nextforge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kotters-8-Steps.jpg)

John Kotter's 8-Step Change Model is a widely recognized framework for managing change. It consists of eight distinct steps:

1.  **Establishing a Sense of Urgency**: Creating a sense of urgency to drive change is essential. This involves identifying and communicating a compelling reason for change.
2.  **Creating a Powerful Coalition**: Building a strong coalition of individuals who can drive change is crucial. This involves identifying key stakeholders and aligning them around the change vision.
3.  **Creating a Vision for Change**: Developing a clear, inspiring vision for change is essential. This vision should be communicated effectively to gain support and commitment.
4.  **Communicating the Vision**: Communicating the change vision and its benefits to all stakeholders is vital for success.
5.  **Empowering Others to Act**: Empowering others to act and take ownership of the change is essential. This involves providing resources and support to enable change.
6.  **Planning for and Creating Short-Term Wins**: Planning for and creating short-term wins is important to build momentum and maintain support for the change.
7.  **Consolidating Gains and Sustaining Acceleration**: Consolidating gains and sustaining acceleration is crucial to ensure the change is embedded and becomes the new norm.
8.  **Institutionalizing Change**: Institutionalizing change is essential to ensure the change becomes a permanent part of the organization's culture.

</div>
```

### Prosci's ADKAR Model

![](images/adkar.webp)

Prosci's ADKAR Model is another popular change management model that focuses on individual change. It consists of five key elements:

1.  **Awareness**: Building awareness of the need for change and the change vision.
2.  **Desire**: Developing the desire to support and participate in the change.
3.  **Knowledge**: Providing the necessary knowledge and skills to implement the change.
4.  **Ability**: Enabling individuals to effectively execute the change.
5.  **Reinforcement**: Reinforcing the change to ensure it becomes a habit and is sustained over time.

### Lewin's Change Management Model

![](images/lewin.webp)

Lewin's Change Management Model, also known as the Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze Model, is a simple yet effective approach to change management. It consists of three stages:

1.  **Unfreeze**: This stage involves creating a sense of urgency and preparing the organization for change.
2.  **Change**: This stage involves implementing the change and making the necessary adjustments.
3.  **Refreeze**: This stage involves stabilizing the change and making it a permanent part of the organization's culture.

### Translating the Models into Each Other

While each model has its unique strengths, they can be translated into each other to provide a more comprehensive change management approach. For example, Kotter's 8-Step Change Model can be seen as a more detailed version of Lewin's Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze Model, with each step representing a different aspect of the change process. Similarly, the ADKAR Model can be seen as a more individual-focused approach, providing a framework for understanding and managing the personal aspects of change.

### Managerial Guide for Applying Change Models

Change management models, such as Kotter's 8-Step Change Model, Prosci's ADKAR Model, and Lewin's Change Management Model, provide valuable insights and frameworks for managing organizational change. However, these models should be adapted and integrated with the specific context of the change and the organization to ensure their effectiveness. Following are some key evidence-based change management principles to consider when applying these models in practice [@stouten_successful_2018].

</div>
```
Several valuable lessons about change management can be learned from Satya Nadella's journey as CEO of Microsoft, as outlined in the video. Here are key takeaways and how they align with evidence-based change management principles:

1.  **Embrace Change and Innovation (Principle 3: Implement Evidence-Based Change Interventions)**: Nadella's leadership at Microsoft highlights the importance of embracing change and pursuing innovation, especially with his focus on cloud computing and AI technologies. This principle emphasizes the need for organizations to adopt evidence-based interventions. Nadella shifted Microsoft's strategy towards areas like cloud services and open-source software, demonstrating a willingness to adapt and reinvent the company based on emerging trends and data.

2.  **Focus on Mission and Culture (Principles 1 and 5)**: Under Nadella, Microsoft redefined its mission to "empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more." This refocusing on mission and the subsequent cultural shift towards a "learn-it-all" rather than a "know-it-all" culture reflects the principles of diagnosing the need for change and formulating a clear, compelling vision. Nadella understood that for change to be sustainable, it had to be rooted in a strong sense of purpose and supported by a culture that values learning and growth.

3.  **Collaboration Over Competition (Principle 6: Work with Social Networks and Tap Their Influence)**: Nadella's approach to partnerships and his decision to make Microsoft's products available on competing platforms like iOS and Android demonstrate an understanding of the importance of leveraging social networks and collaborative ecosystems. By focusing on how Microsoft could contribute to and benefit from broader technological ecosystems, Nadella tapped into new sources of value and growth.

4.  **Empathy and Dialogue (Principle 10: Institutionalize the Change to Sustain Its Effectiveness)**: Nadella emphasized empathy and open dialogue within Microsoft. This approach to leadership and change management aligns with the principle of institutionalizing change, as it fosters an environment where continuous learning and adaptation become part of the organizational DNA. By valuing empathy and encouraging rich dialogue, Nadella worked to ensure that changes would be deeply embedded in Microsoft's culture, leading to sustained effectiveness.

5.  **Navigating Future Challenges (Principle 9: Monitor Progress and Adjust Strategies as Needed)**: The video also touches on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. Nadella's focus on navigating the AI transition with responsibility and ethical consideration reflects the need for ongoing monitoring of progress and the willingness to adjust strategies based on new information and evolving circumstances.

</div>
```
The social network experiment described in the video touches upon several key evidence-based change management principles, notably principles 1 and 3. Let's explore how these principles relate to the described experiment.

#### Principle 1: Diagnosis Step #1 {.unnumbered}

**Description**: Gathering detailed information to understand the need for change and pre-existing conditions.

**Connection**: The social network experiment conducted within Google aimed to understand the patterns of work-related advice-seeking among employees. This initiative represents a form of diagnosis where detailed information about internal social networks was collected. By identifying who employees turn to for advice, the company aimed to grasp the structure of informal networks, which is crucial for understanding existing collaboration patterns and potential areas for improvement. This principle directly applies here as the experiment sought to diagnose how social networks within the organization might influence performance, information flow, and ultimately, decision-making processes.

#### Principle 3: Implement Evidence-Based Interventions {.unnumbered}

**Description**: Choosing interventions based on a well-conducted diagnosis, considering internal and external expertise, stakeholder input, and scientific evidence to identify solutions that address diagnosed problems.

**Connection**: The identification of social network patterns allows Google to make informed decisions on interventions that could enhance collaboration, information sharing, and innovation across different segments of the company. For example, the findings could lead to creating cross-functional teams, redesigning physical workspaces to promote interactions among diverse groups, or developing programs that encourage networking beyond one's immediate circle. This principle is exemplified by the proactive steps taken following the analysis, aiming to bridge the identified gaps and foster a more interconnected and collaborative culture.

## Interventions

![](images/caluwe.webp)

The original De Caluwe model for change management interventions is based on five different ways of thinking about change, each representing different beliefs systems and convictions about how change works, the kind of interventions that are effective, and how to change people. These five models are labeled by color: yellow, blue, red, green, and white.

1.  **Yellow-Print Thinking**: This model is based on socio-political concepts about organizations, where interests, conflicts, and power play important roles. It assumes that people change their standpoints only if their own interests are taken into account or if they are compelled to accept certain ideas. Combining ideas or points of view and forming coalitions or power blocks are favored methods in this type of change process.

2.  **Blue-Print Thinking**: This model is based on the rational design and implementation of change. It assumes that people or things will change if a clearly specified result is laid down beforehand. Controlling the change by managing, planning, and monitoring the progress is considered feasible. The process and the result are deemed, more or less, independent of people. Management is able to compel and effect the change.

3.  **Red-Print Thinking**: This model has its roots in action-learning theories. It emphasizes the human factor in change and focuses on stimulating, attracting, compelling, and guiding people to change. The human being must be influenced, and the foremost consideration is that the human factor plays a vital role in change.

4.  **Green-Print Thinking**: This model is based on action-learning theories and learning organizations. It emphasizes the importance of collective learning and the strengthening of learning abilities within the organization. The aim is to strengthen the learning abilities of the individual and the learning within the organization, which leads to different organizational behavior and change as a result.

5.  **White-Print Thinking**: This model is based on the belief that "crisis provides opportunity." It focuses on observing what is making things happen and change, supplying meanings and perspectives, removing obstacles, getting initiatives and explorations going, and empowering people while giving them sufficient free rein.

These models function as communication and diagnostic tools, providing a map of possible change strategies. Change agents can use these models to reflect on their own assumptions, competencies, and limitations, helping them to delineate their area of expertise and their professional development.

The model has significant implications for change agents and change processes.

1.  **Diagnosing Organizations**: The model emphasizes the need to diagnose organizations from different colored viewpoints to be aware of imbalances. Change agents must understand the dominant paradigms within groups or organizations to effectively characterize the actors involved in a change effort.

2.  **Selecting Change Strategies**: Different colored approaches can interfere with each other significantly. Change agents need to focus on a foundational color strategy that aligns with the organization's context and issue at hand. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each color is crucial for selecting the most appropriate change strategy.

3.  **Managing Interferences**: Change agents should be mindful of potential interferences between different colored actions. Strategies to deal with interferences include spacing out interventions in time or involving different people for different color interventions. Maintaining a constant underlying color tenet while allowing for contributions from other colors can be challenging but beneficial.

4.  **Matching Change Agents to Change Efforts**: It is essential for change agents to align their approach with the nature of the change effort. Incongruence between the color of the change agent and the desired change strategy can impede progress. Ensuring that the change agent's style matches the chosen color strategy is crucial for successful change implementation.

5.  **Facilitating Learning and Adaptation**: The model underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation within organizations. Change agents should create settings for collective learning, support people in taking ownership of their learning, and foster a culture of continuous learning in collective settings. This approach allows for flexibility, experimentation, and growth within the organization.

By understanding these implications and applying them effectively in practice, change agents can navigate complex change processes more adeptly, tailor interventions to specific organizational contexts, and foster sustainable organizational development through strategic and thoughtful change management practices.
