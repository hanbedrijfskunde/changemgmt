The social network experiment described from the transcript touches upon several key evidence-based change management principles, notably principles 1 and 3. Let's explore how these principles relate to the described experiment and identify any additional connections to other principles from the provided list.

#### Principle 1: Diagnosis Step #1 {-}

**Description**: Gathering detailed information to understand the need for change and pre-existing conditions.

**Connection**: The social network experiment conducted within Google aimed to understand the patterns of work-related advice-seeking among employees. This initiative represents a form of diagnosis where detailed information about internal social networks was collected. By identifying who employees turn to for advice, the company aimed to grasp the structure of informal networks, which is crucial for understanding existing collaboration patterns and potential areas for improvement. This principle directly applies here as the experiment sought to diagnose how social networks within the organization might influence performance, information flow, and ultimately, decision-making processes.

#### Principle 3: Implement Evidence-Based Interventions {-}

**Description**: Choosing interventions based on a well-conducted diagnosis, considering internal and external expertise, stakeholder input, and scientific evidence to identify solutions that address diagnosed problems.

**Connection**: The identification of social network patterns allows Google to make informed decisions on interventions that could enhance collaboration, information sharing, and innovation across different segments of the company. For example, the findings could lead to creating cross-functional teams, redesigning physical workspaces to promote interactions among diverse groups, or developing programs that encourage networking beyond one's immediate circle. This principle is exemplified by the proactive steps taken following the analysis, aiming to bridge the identified gaps and foster a more interconnected and collaborative culture.
